## Recipes App

Front-end group project developed with <a href="https://github.com/FelipeBarbozaa"> @FelipeBarbozaa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brucealberto"> @brucealberto</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AlmosAugusto"> @AlmosAugusto</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mroberti1"> @mroberti1</a> while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

In this group project we developed a recipes mobile app making use of _React Hooks_ and _Context API_ and in it, the user could see, search, filter, favorite and trace the progression of the preparation of drinks and meal recipes. The database for this project came from two distinct APIs (themealdb.com and thecocktaildb.com), one for foods and another one for drinks. The layout made was planned for mobile apps only. The app also counts with 90% of test coverage.
