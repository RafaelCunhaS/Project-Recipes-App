## Recipes App

Front-end group project developed with <a href="https://github.com/FelipeBarbozaa"> @FelipeBarbozaa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brucealberto"> @brucealberto</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AlmosAugusto"> @AlmosAugusto</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mroberti1"> @mroberti1</a> while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The project was developed in a group following the demands of a __Kanban__ board and the __Agiles Methodologies__. We developed a recipes mobile app making use of __React Hooks__ and __Context API__ and in it, the user could see, search, filter, favorite and trace the progression of the preparation of drinks and meal recipes. The database for this project came from two distinct APIs (themealdb.com and thecocktaildb.com), one for foods and another one for drinks. The layout made was planned for mobile apps only. The app also counts with 90% of test coverage with the __React Testing Library__.
